# 📦 AWS Image Upload Web Application

A hands-on cloud project that demonstrates how to build and deploy a simple image upload web application on AWS.

Users can upload images through a web interface hosted on **EC2**. Uploaded files are stored securely in an **S3** bucket. The project showcases core AWS services including **EC2**, **S3**, **IAM**, **CloudWatch**, and optionally **ALB** and **Auto Scaling** for production-ready scalability.
